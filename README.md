# News-Summarizer-Website

Me and my classmates participated in the Scientific Research Session at The Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest. Our project consisted in creating a news summary platform.
Long story short we took the news posted by CNN and summarized them using our own AI trained to do exactly that.

My job was to create a website where our summaries would be displayed.
Sadly my teammate has to do his magic when it comes to sending me the summaries generated by his AI so I can't show them to you but I have some standard text on the website to replace the news.

You can view the website by checking the images in the "preview" folder.

# Or follow these steps:
 - Download the .zip file and extract it
 - Open the Command Prompt and change the working directory to the downloaded file (for me it was: "cd C:\Users\Robert\Desktop\News-Summarizer-Website-main")
 - After that run the app.py program by typing "python app.py"
 - It will display the web adress (it should be something like this "http://127.0.0.1:5000")
 - Copy & paste it in your browser
 - Now uncomment the standard news data in the script.js file (line: 23-65)
 - Refresh the web page
