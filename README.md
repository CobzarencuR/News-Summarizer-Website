# News-Summarizer-Website

Me and my classmates participated in the Scientific Research Session at ASE Bucharest.
Out project consisted in creating a news summary platform.
Long story short we took the news posted by CNN and summarized them using our own AI trained to do exactly that.

My job was to create the website where our summaries would be displayed.
Sadly my teammate has to do his magic with the AI to get the news, summarize them and send them to the website so I can't show you the summarizes but I have some standard text on the website to replace the news.
